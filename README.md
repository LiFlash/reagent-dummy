# reagent-dummy
Repo for reproducing issues and helping me understand the concepts of reagent and affiliates

Since this is based on the reagent-template the app can be launched with
`lein figwheel`

The app shows to lists. One created with reagent, one with kioo. Clicking one of the entries, should change the global state and the local state of the appropriate element.
